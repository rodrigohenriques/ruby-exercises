Ode to Bacon in the SummerTime

(slow, sleazy, dipped in pork fat)

Waking up in the morning
is so very hard to do
just wanna pull the covers back over my head
but the dog is barking
and the cat does meow
and another day has got to be faced
i drag myself to the bathroom
take a good look at my face
ugh, not a pretty site
what’s a gyrl to do?
so we stumble to the kitchen
grind myself a cup
and baby, that’s where it all begins
i want pig
i want dead cooked pig
that’s the only thing that will get me thru
slice the neck
bleed it dry
smoke it
cure it
thick cut fried
gimmie pig
porcine paradise
i want
sausages, bacon, eggs and beans
gimmie soda bread, cheesey bread you know what i mean!
full on ulster fry in my eyes
open wide……
that’s the start of a day
it gets me on my way
wot more can i say (wink wink)
kill me a piggie
and i’ll put it in pie
(insert sultry laughter)
can you smell it?
something in the air
wafting thru my kitchen
burnt flesh
not rare!
crispy greasy crunchy please me
gimmie
bacon
bacon
bacon
bacon
baby please!
i want dead pig
and i want it
now…..
